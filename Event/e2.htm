   <b> How do I identify the type of plastic?</b><br><br>

The easiest way to identify plastic is by locating three arrows forming a triangle with a specific number in the middle that's located at the base of the plastic. These international codes offer clarity to plastic identification based on chemical makeup and the grading for recycling.<br><br>

Our Plastic Bottle Collection Drive aims to raise awareness about the importance of recycling and properly disposing of plastic waste.
