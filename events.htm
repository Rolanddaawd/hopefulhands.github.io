                        <p>Special Care facilities and schools, that cater for children and adults with disabilities, are very much in short supply in Malaysia. Besides this shortage of facilities, the few that do exist often face various challenges on a daily basis (extremely high operating costs, staff shortages, ageing equipment, etc.). The children at these facilities have profound intellectual and physical disabilities and require round-the-clock care.  </p>
